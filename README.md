## Executive Summary ðŸ“Š

This analysis aims to address the significant gap in region-specific health outcome data in developing countries, particularly concerning the impacts of household air pollution. Using data from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and the **Global Data Lab**, a predictive model was developed utilizing variables such as the **International Wealth Index (IWI)**, access to electricity, types of cooking fuels, and other socioeconomic indicators. The study extends national-level predictions to regional levels where data is currently scarce.

The findings suggest that **low-wealth regions**, especially in **Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia**, are associated with disproportionately high rates of adverse health outcomes. These outcomes appear to be linked to poor household conditions, such as reliance on biomass for cooking and limited access to electricity. The analysis indicates that **targeted interventions**, including promoting cleaner cooking fuels and improving access to electricity, may help reduce health disparities in these areas.

Using **random forest regression** and **cluster analysis**, the study identifies key variables most strongly associated with poor health outcomes, such as natural flooring, electricity access, and cooking fuel type. The A/B tests conducted further illustrate the potential impact of improving these household conditions on reducing disease burden, particularly for **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**.

The report concludes that enhancing data granularity and tailoring public health strategies to address specific regional needs are crucial steps toward mitigating the health disparities exacerbated by environmental factors in low-wealth regions. **Public health officials, researchers, and policymakers** should prioritize interventions focused on improving household environments to achieve more equitable health outcomes.
